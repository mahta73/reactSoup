    What is ReactJS?
</h2>
<p>
    React is an open-source javaScript library for building user interfaces which is maintained by Facebook.In other words, react is the view layer for web applications(web and mobile apps).
    React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications.
</p>

<p>
    React allows developers to create large web applications which can change data, without reloading the page. The main purpose of React is to be fast, scalable, and simple.  the big idea behind React is this: what if you could create your own HTML element that has customized functionality? 
</p>

<p>
    React has been designed from the start for gradual adoption, and you can use as little or as much React as you need. Whether you want to get a taste of React, add some interactivity to a simple HTML page, or start a complex React-powered app,

    What are ReactJS features?
</h2>
<ul>
    <li>JSX:  JSX is simple JavaScript which allows HTML quoting and uses these HTML tag syntax to render subcomponents.</li>
    <li>React Native</li>
    <li>Single-Way data flow</li>
    <li>Virtual Document Object Model: React creates an in-memory data structure cache which computes the changes made and then updates the browser.</li>
</ul>

<h2 style = 'text-align: center'>How does ReactJS work?</h2>
<p>
    React operates not directly on the browser's Document Object Model(DOM) immediately, but on a vitual DOM. That is, rather than manipulating the document in a browser after changes to our data it resolves changes on a DOM built and run entirely in memory. After the virtual DOM has been updated,
    React intelligently determines what changes to make to the actual browser's DOM.
